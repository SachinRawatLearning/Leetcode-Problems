// You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

// You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

// Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

// Example 1:

// Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
// Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
// Example 2:

// Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

// Constraints:

// 1 <= prices.length <= 105
// 0 <= prices[i] <= 104
//

/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}

// Kadane's Algorithm
// Kadane's Algorithm is a dynamic programming technique used to find the maximum subarray sum in an array of numbers. The algorithm maintains two variables: max_current represents the maximum sum ending at the current position, and max_global represents the maximum subarray sum encountered so far. At each iteration, it updates max_current to include the current element or start a new subarray if the current element is larger than the accumulated sum. The max_global is updated if max_current surpasses its value.

// Complexity
// Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the prices array. The algorithm iterates through the array once.
// Space complexity: O(1), as only a constant amount of extra space is used.
